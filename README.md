## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |

**Prompt used to generate the hero image:**

An ultra-detailed 8K widescreen hero background (3840 × 2160) for a SaaS website — midnight-indigo-to-deep-teal gradient, luminous cyan & emerald accents. Abstract flowing data ribbons weave across the canvas, converging into a soft-glow chat-bubble silhouette at center-right; faint wireframe UI panels and dotted node constellations hint at real-time knowledge retrieval. Cinematic volumetric lighting with subtle bokeh, glass-morphism shards, and gentle ray-traced reflections give a refined, Apple-esque polish while leaving plenty of negative space for copy on the left. No text, no branding, just an elegant, future-forward vibe that suggests 24×7 multilingual AI support. Rendered in photorealistic 3-D concept-art style, trending on ArtStation, highly aesthetic.
